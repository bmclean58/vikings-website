The website that I chose to emulate is minnesotavikings.com.
This is the official website of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League. Which happens to be my favorite team as I am from Minnesota.

I tried to use as little CSS as possible when styling this website. I relied on bootstrap styling for most of it and even added some Bootstrap components such as the navigation bar, table that shows key dates, carousel of pictures, grid layout for the 2025 opponents, tabs and accordion dropdowns for the depth chart, and used Bootstrap's contact form for the Fan Club signup.

The first function is a constructor for a Fan Club member object. The object stores the name and email address of a single member. This constructor would be invoked every time someone signed up for the Fan Club.

The second function adds a Fan Club member to an array of member objects. Adds the member to a list of members. This would also be called every time a new member joins.

The third function takes in a member object as a parameter and returns the info for that member. The info includes name and email. This function could have many issues and will be used in my next function. 

The fourth function loops through the array of member objects and displays the information for each member. This function uses the previous function to display that information. This would be handy if they ever needed to print out a full list of members.
